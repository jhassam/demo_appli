There Might be situation when you land up with the error “‘rake/rdoctask’ is obsolete and no longer supported. Use ‘rdoc/task’ (available in RDoc 2.4.2+) instead“.

This situation happens when you are trying to run command “db:migrate” and
1. You are new to Rails ( ;) )
2. No, when your default environment consists of new rake version, and application needs old one.

3. Best Option to specify old rake version i.e. ’0.8.7′

How to fix the problem, Follow steps

1. Open your gemfile (It is present in project folder, directly)

5. run command bundle install, to install missing gems, if any.
bundle install
6. and your problem is solved.
7. Good Luck.
